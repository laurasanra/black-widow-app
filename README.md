This is a Comic Finder based on Black-Widow character. The app is responsive.

I have used the following technologies:
- JavaScript
- React
- HTML5
- SASS
- Data consumption through Marvel Public API

The structure of the project is based on components organized in two large blocks:
- Listing: the list of comics with filter options.
- Detail: the information about the selected comic.

The app is responsive.

The app is hosted in Heroku and Github pages:
https://black-widow-comic-finder.herokuapp.com/

In order to work on the project you must:
- Clone the repository on your premises
- Install required packages: run npm install
- Start the project for visualization: run npm start
- Upload project to production: run npm run deploy
